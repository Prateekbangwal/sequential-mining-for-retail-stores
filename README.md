Association and sequential rules have been widely used for many years in solving various practical issues, such as consumer behavior in marketing research, recommendation systems in e-commerce and protein sequences in biometrics . The main difference between mining association rules and sequential rules is that association rules only concern the co-occurrence relationship between items and ignore the sequential pattern between items .In general, the problems of association and sequential rules can be categorized as unsupervised or supervised, depending on whether a decision variable exists. In this project, we focus on unsupervised association and sequential rules. Since they have no decision variables, the supervised problems can be considered to be classification problems and a number of algorithms can be used to solve them. Sequential pattern mining is a data mining technique used to identify patterns of ordered events. With increasing applications on item set data mining has been applied to the distributed environment of large amount of data.
